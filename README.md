## Developing
*Note*: This section is only relevant if you would like to develop project yourself.

Make sure you have Flutter installed. Then clone this repo and follow these steps.

1. Get dependencies using flutter command. For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
```shell
flutter pub get
```

2. We use [`built_value.dart`](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart) to serializing json to models, and autogenerated files are ignored by source control (git),  so we should generate those files before run app.
```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

3. Run the following commands, replace MODE with flutterMode that defined in flutter.
```shell
flutter run --MODE
```
